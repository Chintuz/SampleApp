This is a Sample Application using MVP structure. 

Here I am fetching a data from "http://services.hanselandpetal.com" as a BASE_URL and API end point as a "/feeds/flowers.json" using retrofit.

The 3rd party libraries used as below:  
1 - Butterknife  
2 - retrofit2  
3 - rxjava & rxandroid  
4 - dagger

The application shows a perfect model of MVP flow structure.
